# rplace_minecraft

I'm running this on a Windows 10 computer with Java and Minecraft. Currently it doesn't seem to be having a problem with that.

Uses code from [this stack overflow post](http://stackoverflow.com/a/11910555/1687505)

Uses Python3 and the pypi package [PlaceScraper](https://github.com/PlaceDevs/place-scraper)

This requires a RUNNING MINECRAFT CLIENT that you switch focus to after running key.py! This also requires op permissions.

Install:

```
pip3 install websocket-client
pip3 install placescraper
pip3 install requests 

python.exe key.py
```
